Developers
==========

If you want to use *pyirf* and also contribute to its development, follow these steps:

  1. Fork the official `repository <https://github.com/cta-observatory/pyirf>`_ has explained `here <https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo>`__ (follow all the instructions)
  2. now your local copy is linked to your remote repository (**origin**) and the official one (**upstream**)
  3. execute points 3 and 4 in the instructions for :ref:`basic`.
  4. install *pyirf* itself in developer mode with ``python setup.py develop``

In this way, you will always use the version of the source code on which you
are working.

Next steps:

 * get accustomed to the basics (:ref:`perf`),
 * start using *pyirf* (:ref:`usage`),
 * for bugs and new features, please contribute to the project (:ref:`contribute`).
